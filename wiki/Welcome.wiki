= Introduction =

As3 RPC lib is a set of libraries that can be used with Flex 2 or AS 3 to invoke remote procedure calls using:
  * AMF0 (Flash Remoting MX)
  * XML-RPC 
  * JSON-RPC (Coming Soon)

Usage mimics the RemoteObject which is available natively in [http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flex/2/langref/ Flex 2] in an effort to make usage in existing frameworks (e.g. Cairngorm) and design pattern (e.g. Token pattern) easy as possible.

= Updates =

  * Added library to downloads
